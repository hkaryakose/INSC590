# GENERAL INFORMATION
**1. Title of Project:** OSF INSC 590 - Group 1 - The Impact of Money Invested and the Return in  Medals at the Summer Olympics , 1960-2008

This project makes use of a variety of open-source data to explore the impact of money invested in Olympic programs around the world and the return realized in terms of medals won. Like scientific data, quantitative studies in the humanities rely on well-sourced, accurate data. Increasingly powerful computers allow for the automated harvesting of extremely large datasets. These datasets, in turn, make it possible to explore a broad range of questions. The question that interests us, in particular, is whether patterns emerge when exploring the financial investment in Olympic sports that always correlate with the number of medals earned. Or, are there cases where countries, particularly those that are smaller and less well funded, enjoy a consistent or sustained success in certain events.
